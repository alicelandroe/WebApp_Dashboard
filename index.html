<!-- Create a responsive web page from the supplied dashboard.png mockup with the following:

Header with app name, notification icon badge, and profile avatar and name.

SVG icon based navigation with the following links: Dashboard, Members, Visits, and Settings. 

NOTE: You only have to build out the main dashboard page, not any of the other pages.

Main content area where the specific dashboard widgets will go.

Ensure that the design responds well to mobile (320px), tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px) screen sizes.

Use CSS grid to lay out the main elements (header, sidebar navigation, main content) on the page. -->
